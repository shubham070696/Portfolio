## Project Proposal: 

## 1. Outline: 

For my final project, I want to focus on Chroic Diseases in the United States which are ongoing and incurable diseases. I want to tell a visual story to demonstrate different various statistics and facts with visualizations which will make my audience understand how bad the current situation is and the consequences if continued to be ignorant towards these conditions.

Chronic diseases in the US is a serious problem with every 6 out of 10 people having some chronic condition, which will over time cost a lot in terms of money and the quality of life. I want to draw attention to the most common Chronic diseases that includes: hypertension, coronary heart disease, stroke, diabetes, cancer, arthritis, hepatitis, weak or failing kidneys, current asthma, and COPD.


A basic outline of my priject would look like:
* What are the leading causes of death and disability?
* What are Chronic Diseases and are they serious?
* Health Risk behaviors that cause chronic diseases.
* Cost of Chronic diseases
* How can they be prevented?

## 3. Data: 

[The Centre for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/chronicdisease/index.htm) has all the information related to my topic. 

## 4. Method and Medium: 

I am thinking of working on this final project in iterative fashion and the steps in each iteration are outlined below: 

### Phase 1 (Current): 

  * Researching and gaining a thorough understanding of the topic.
  * Key facts and statistics that I want to convey. 
  * Create a story arc of emotions that I want my audience to feel as they go through my work.
  * Get User Feedback on story arc and any suggestions
  * Initial Sketches of the vizualizations

### Phase 2:
  * Gather data and Perform cleaning using Python
  * Create wireframes for vizualiaztions from the initial sketches
  * Creating the vizualizations using Tableau, Flourish studio etc. 
  * Refining and tweaking
  
###  Phase 3:
 * Using Shorthand to put pieces together
 * Presentation to the class
 

### Tools that I will be using 
* **Shortand** 
* **Tableau** 
* **Sketches**
* **Python for data cleaning**
* **Flourish Studio**
