### Introduction
I decided to critique and redesign the visual on the following link: [The cost of renting a home vs Buying a home for every state in the US] (https://howmuch.net/articles/cost-renting-vs-owning-home)

I choose this visualization as to see in which state renting is more benficial rather then buying a home. The primary benefit of renting an apartment is flexibility. Renters can have a hassel free movement to a different neighbourhood without having to worry about selling their homes.

Redesigning this visual would help the people understand much better about what decisions should they be taking about renting or buying when moving to these states and can help them make better decisions.

Below is the initial visualiztaion:
