### Introduction
I decided to critique and redesign the visual on the following link: [The cost of renting a home vs Buying a home for every state in the US](https://howmuch.net/articles/cost-renting-vs-owning-home)

I choose this visualization as to see in which state renting is more benficial rather then buying a home. The primary benefit of renting an apartment is flexibility. Renters can have a hassel free movement to a different neighbourhood without having to worry about selling their homes.

Redesigning this visual would help the people understand much better about what decisions should they be taking about renting or buying when moving to these states and can help them make better decisions.

Below is the initial visualiztaion:

### Critques of the visualization
I think the following points don't work in the above visualization and can be improved to give people more advanced and insightful view about which option to choose amongst renting or buying.
1. The visual shows a stacked bar chart comparing average monthly mortgage payments and monthly rent payments  to do a comparison but using a different metric which is difference between renting and buying monthly payments would make much more sense.
2. The stacked bar chart uses 2 different colors pink and blue to convey the information about mortgage payments on the left and renting on the right respectively. A much more efficient way could be the usage of the same color (maybe blue or yellow) of bar now since we have changed the metric of comparison.
3. The visual is sorted by the monthly mortgage payments but then on the right side it becomes unsorted and then it becomes hard for the viewer to judge. 


### Wireframe of the solution
I created an initital wireframe of my solution, a simple pen and paper sketch, as shown below:
