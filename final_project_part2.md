## Story Flow: 

Chronic conditions are defined as conditions that last more than a year and which require ongoing medical attention. They are the leading drivers of the nation's budget on healthcare which is $3.8 trillion in annual healthcare costs.

**% of US adults aged 18 or above with number of chronic diseases**

I have created a pie chart in order to viusalize and see the percentage of adults aged 18 or above with number of chronic illness and approximately 27% of the adults have more than 2 chronic conditions.

</script>
  
**Leading causes of deaths in the US**

 I am trying to identify and club how many of the deaths were caused by diseases that fall under the category of chronic illnes vs the ones that don't fall under that category for which I have used datawrapper to generate the chart. From the viusalization it is clear that majority of the deaths occur due to heart disease and cancer.

</script>
  
  
**Percentage of healthcare spending**
  
 Some key insights that I found from this was that with each number of conditions, with each additional chronic condition, the amount of health care expenditure increases and increase more than double. 35% of the healthcare spending is on 8.7% people who are sufferring with more than 5 chronic conditions.

**Healthcare spending per capita**
  
Compared to those without any chronic conditions:
  
â€¢ Spending is almost 2.5 times morefor those with one, 6 times more with 3 and 13.5 times more than with 5 or more chronic conditions

## 2. Key behaviors that lead to chronic diseases
  
  * Excessive tobacco use and passive smoking
  * Poor diet
  * Lack of physical activity
  * Excessive alcholol use

Above is a rough draft of the Shorthand page that I Will be developing as part of my this project. I am still working on integrating the pieces once my visualizations are finzlized.
  
  
## My Target Audience: 

My target audience is the general public. I want to focus on the various chronic conditions that affect adults and what their affects are. Since the scope of this topic is quite broad and to focus on providing more relevant details to the audience, I am continuosly working on finding ways to convey my information with more effective visualizations. Since I want my audience to be more aware of how deadly and serious these chronic diseases are and provide them with ways to prevent them. 

## Interview Script: 
  
  I decided to interview 3 people with the following questions:
  
  1. Could you summarize the central idea of the webpage?
  2. Do you understand the flow of topics, is the flow of information correct?
  3. What do you understood from vizualisations, are they effective? Is there anything that you would want me to change even if that's related to color scheme or background of        any section of the page?
  
 
## Findings from the interview
  
   1. Could you summarize the central idea of the webpage?

    * Everybody understood the central idea of my story - it is about the seriousness of chronic diseases and how to prevent them.
    * Avoiding chronic diseases are very important, otherwise it can cost an individual is lot.
   
    2. Do you understand the flow of topics, is the flow of information correct?
  
    * Everybody found the flow of topics to be appropriate, seems to covey the information that is necessary but suggested some improvements in teh visualisation.
  
    3. What do you understood from vizualisations, are they effective? Is there anything that you would want me to change even if that's related to color scheme or background of        any section of the page?
  
     * They seem to have some problem in understanding the graph "leading causes of deaths in the US". They pointed out that it would have been better, if it had x-axis                 labels and instead of the static number on the bars as values, it could have better if on hovering on the bars the labels along with values would be shown.
     * They pointed out that in the section of healthcare spending, color sceheme can be changed to be more consistent with the whole story on shorthand.
     * Legends and labels to be more appealing in the visualizations.
  
## Changes to be implemented:
   
  1. Adding and refining the current visualizations with clearer legends and labels, color scheme.
  2. Integrate the changes on shorthand.
  3. Adding the leading risk factors writeup.
