## Story Flow: 

## 1. Introduction: 

Chronic conditions are defined as conditions that last more than a year and which require ongoing medical attention. They are the leading drivers of the nation's budget on healthcare which is $3.8 trillion in annual healthcare costs.

**% of US adults aged 18 or above with number of chronic diseases**

I have created a pie chart in order to viusalize and see the percentage of adults aged 18 or above with number of chronic illness and approximately 27% of the adults have more than 2 chronic conditions.

</script>
  
**Leading causes of deaths in the US**

 I am trying to identify and club how many of the deaths were caused by diseases that fall under the category of chronic illnes vs the ones that don't fall under that category for which I have used datawrapper to generate the chart. From the viusalization it is clear that majority of the deaths occur due to heart disease and cancer.

</script>
  
  
**Percentage of healthcare spending**
  
 Some key insights that I found from this was that with each number of conditions, with each additional chronic condition, the amount of health care expenditure increases and increase more than double. 35% of the healthcare spending is on 8.7% people who are sufferring with more than 5 chronic conditions.

**Healthcare spending per capita**
  
Compared to those without any chronic conditions:
  
â€¢ Spending is almost 2.5 times morefor those with one, 6 times more with 3 and 13.5 times more than with 5 or more chronic conditions

## 2. Key behaviors that lead to chronic diseases
  
  * Excessive tobacco use and passive smoking
  * Poor diet
  * Lack of physical activity
  * Excessive alcholol use
  
  
  
## My Target Audience: 

My target audience is the general public. I want to focus on the various chronic conditions that affect adults and what their affects are. Since the scope of this topic is quite broad and to focus on providing more relevant details to the audience, I am continuosly working on finding ways to convey my information with more effective visualizations. Since I want my audience to be more aware of how deadly and serious these chronic diseases are and provide them with ways to prevent them.
