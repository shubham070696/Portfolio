## Story Flow: 

## 1. Introduction: 

Chronic conditions are defined as conditions that last more than a year and which require ongoing medical attention. They are the leading drivers of the nation's budget on healthcare which is $3.8 trillion in annual healthcare costs.

**% of US adults aged 18 or above with number of chronic diseases**

I have created a pie chart in order to viusalize and see the percentage of adults aged 18 or above with number of chronic illness and approximately 27% of the adults have more than 2 chronic conditions.



* <iframe title="[ % US adults aged 18 and above with chronic conditions]" aria-label="chart" id="datawrapper-chart-LQPf9" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/LQPf9/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="464"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
</script>
  
**Leading causes of deaths in the US**

 I am trying to identify and club how many of the deaths were caused by diseases that fall under the category of chronic illnes vs the ones that don't fall under that category for which I have used datawrapper to generate the chart. From the viusalization it is clear that majority of the deaths occur due to heart disease and cancer.
