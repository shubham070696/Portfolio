# About the data
General government debt-to-GDP ratio measures the gross debt of the general government as a percentage of GDP. It is a key indicator for the sustainability of government finance. Debt is calculated as the sum of the following liability categories (as applicable): currency and deposits; debt securities, loans; insurance, pensions and standardised guarantee schemes, and other accounts payable. Changes in government debt over time primarily reflect the impact of past government deficits.

# Visualizing data 3
To this visualization I added the flexibility for the user to choose the countires and look at their Debt-to-GDP Ratio individually and analyze the data if required. This looks more cleaner than the previous which was a stack of all the graphs together. It is also a line chart which represents the ratio in a time series from 1994 to 2020 but with an option for the user to select from a dropdown menu of countries.
