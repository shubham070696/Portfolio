Portfolio Page for Telling Stories with Data

# About me
Hi, I am Shubham Jain, a graduate student at Heinz College, Carnegie Mellon University, pursuing my Masters in Information Systems Management. Before coming to CMU, I was working as a software developer at Philips HealthCare Systems. I strive to develop things that can bring change to society by transforming data into decisions. My greatest ability is to stay true to my work. The fondness of analysis and prediction amplified my interest in the field of data science driving me to explore more in this domain and gain thorough in-depth knowledge of several tools, techniques, and technologies. Over the next few years, I wish to not only understand the technical aspects of data science but also to ensure the ethical style of storytelling with data.

Speaking of a few fun facts about me, I am really passionate about football and a huge fan of Cristiano Ronaldo.
