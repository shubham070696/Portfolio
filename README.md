Portfolio Page for Telling Stories with Data

# About me
Hi, I am Shubham Jain, a graduate student at Heinz College, Carnegie Mellon University, pursuing my Masters in Information Systems Management. Before coming to CMU, I was working as a software developer at Philips HealthCare Systems. I strive to develop things that can bring change to society by transforming data into decisions. My greatest ability is to stay true to my work. The fondness of analysis and prediction amplified my interest in the field of data science driving me to explore more in this domain and gain thorough in-depth knowledge of several tools, techniques, and technologies. Over the next few years, I wish to not only understand the technical aspects of data science but also to ensure the ethical style of storytelling with data.

Speaking of a few fun facts about me, I am really passionate about football and a huge fan of Cristiano Ronaldo.

# What I hope to learn
I hope to be profecient with expressing stories throguh data since data visualization is of paramount importance in order to work with data.

# Portfolio
Here's all of my cool work related to visualizations will go.

# About the data
General government debt-to-GDP ratio measures the gross debt of the general government as a percentage of GDP. It is a key indicator for the sustainability of government finance. Debt is calculated as the sum of the following liability categories (as applicable): currency and deposits; debt securities, loans; insurance, pensions and standardised guarantee schemes, and other accounts payable. Changes in government debt over time primarily reflect the impact of past government deficits.


# Visualizing data 1
The below visualization represents the value on y-axis across different locations from the year 2020. The user can hover over the bar to see  the value for that particular location.

# Visualizing data 2 
The below graph is a grid of line charts.

# Visualizing data 3
To this visualization I added the flexibility for the user to choose the countires and look at their Debt-to-GDP Ratio individually and analyze the data if required. This looks more cleaner than the previous which was a stack of all the graphs together. It is also a line chart which represents the ratio in a time series from 1994 to 2020 but with an option for the user to select from a dropdown menu of countries.
