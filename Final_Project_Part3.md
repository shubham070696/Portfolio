## Final Project Part III:

After carfeul consideration of feedbacks from different people and since I already mentioned in my part1 that my target audience will be the gneeral public of United States as spreading awareness about such a topic is beneficial for everyone and would eventually educate everyone about the seriousness of the issue. Therefore, to convey my story effectively, I put a lot of focus towards these areas:

* Introducing the audience to chronic diseases.
* What is the scope of the problem and why should the general public be concerned?
* How costly chronic disease treatment is? How does it impact the nation's health budget?
* Risk factors associated with chronic diseases.
* Can they be prevented? If yes, how?

Since I had already mentioned in part1, that the scope of this project is quite broad and there are a lot more things that are still left uncovered, but my major aim through this project was to only focus on conveying one message to my audience about how serious this issue is?

I used vizualizations which were the most simple and effective to convey the message I inteded to convey, like bar charts, pie charts etc. The visulaizations that I included are as follows:

**% US adults aged 18 and above with chronic conditions**

<iframe title="% US adults aged 18 and above with chronic conditions" aria-label="chart" id="datawrapper-chart-LQPf9" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/LQPf9/4/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="464"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();</script>

## Changes made to the initial story

* The flow of the story makes much more sense now than before as it was scattered.

* I have made my visulaizations much more clearer by including the legends and breif descriptive titles that are more self explanatory.

* I have tried to also incorporate a section about ways to prevent chronic diseases rather than just focusing on the issue that how serious it is.
 
 
 ## Design Desicions
 
* I tried creating different sections that highlight different topics that I want my audience to pay attention to regarding my topic.
 
* I tried creating flow of my story, which starts with introduction, then moving on to the facts about chronic diseases to show the audience about the seriousness and then how are they caused and then lastly how can they be prevented.
 
 * My theme switches between black and white, where black denotes the information that the audience should pay attention to and white for the visualizations. I chose white for visualizations to make the text and data visible clearly.

## Observations
 
Since I have worked in healthcare domain before landing in the states and I know about the conditions of healthcare in India and so my motivation of taking up this porject was to see how does the condition in the United States differ from India. Is it better or worse? I did see a lot of trend and could relate.
 
* Identified the leading causes of deaths
* On the government level, how much does the US government spend on the US's healthcare
* How does the spending increases with the increase in chronic conditions.
